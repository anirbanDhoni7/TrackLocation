# ASSIGNMENT DETAILS 
1. Email/Password Login Authentication set up using few demo credentials, set at only app end - Credentials are given below and those are hard coded in Line No. 33 of App.js file - because of absence of any specific Login API, I could not able to set up login-signup conventional flow 
2. Latitude, Longitude & Check in date time will be shown at the app end but because of the lack of Google Maps Paid API Key, Google Address and map plotting could not be done 

To get Google Address of a specific latitude-longitude pair, following Google API need to be called :- 

fetch('https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=' + myLat + ',' + myLon + '&key=' + myApiKey)
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((responseJson) => {
            console.log('Google Address Details => ' + JSON.stringify(responseJson));
})

3. To show tracking routes in Google Maps, @react-native-maps/polyline-direction this package can be used with a Paid Google Maps API Key. 

4. Background or Lock Screen Location Tracking is done by react-native-background-timer package 

5. Current location is found by react-native-get-location package 

6. Hard Coded Login Authentication is obtained by the combination of @react-native-async-storage/async-storage package and React Context API

7. As I have no API to update tracked location details in a server, I have implemented the process of background tracking acknowledgement section in terms of WhatsApp message sending - just user need to provide his/her WhatsApp Contact Details to get background tracking location - Code is written in Line No. 64 of src\screens\CheckInScreen.js path
